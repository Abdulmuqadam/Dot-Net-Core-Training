Diff btw Authentication and authorization:
Authentication:
	is a process of verifying the user by it given credentials which are stored
Example: When you log in to a web service using your username and password, you are authenticating yourself. The service checks if the provided credentials match the 
stored user information to verify your identity.

Autherization:
	is a process of come after the authentication and determines what actions or resources an authenticated user or system is allowed to access.
Example: In a RESTful API, even if a user has successfully authenticated, they might not be authorized to perform certain actions. For instance, a regular user may be 
authorized to read data but not to update or delete it, while an admin user has broader access.

Types of authentication:
There are three types of authentication:
.Basic Auth
.Jwt Auth
.Role Based Auth

Basic Auth in Asp.Net WebAPi:
Disadvantages:
>User credentials are sent in the request.
>Credentials are sent as plaintext.
>Credentials are sent with every request.
>No way to log out, except by ending the browser session.
>Vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF); requires anti-CSRF measures.
Advantages:
>Internet standard
>Supported by all major browsers
>Relatively simple protocol.

Basic Authentication works as follows:
1. If a request authentication, the server returns 401 (Unauthorized). The response includes a WWW-Authenticate header, indicating the server supports Basic 
authentication.
2. The client sends another request with the client credentials in the Authorization header. The credentials are formatted as the string "name:password:, 
base64-encodeed. The credentials are not encrypted.

Basic Authentication Scheme
.is a simple and widely supported authentication scheme.
.it involves sending the username and password as credentials with each request.
.Credentials are abse64 encoded and sent in the authorization header of the request as basic.
.server verifies the credentials by decoding the base64 encoded string and checking against a user or auth provider.
.if credentials are valid the server grants access to the requested resource.
.Basic auth does not provide state or session management each request requires he credentials to be sent.
.the main advantage of basic authentication is its simplicity but it lacks in security as the credentials are sent with each request in base64 encoding (which
can be easily decoded).
