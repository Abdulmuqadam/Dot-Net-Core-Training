Authentication and Authorization: 
	are essential components of building secure ASP.NET Core Web APIs. They help ensure that only authenticated users can access certain resources and that those 
users have the appropriate permissions to perform specific actions. Let's break down these concepts in the context of ASP.NET Core Web API.

Authentication:
	is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In ASP.NET Core Web API, you can implement authentication using various methods, including:

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): 
	This is a popular method for authentication in modern web applications. It involves the issuance of a token to the client after successful login. The client 
then includes this token in subsequent requests, and the server validates the token to authenticate the user.

Cookie-based authentication: 
	ASP.NET Core also supports traditional cookie-based authentication, where a session cookie is used to maintain user authentication.

OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:
	These are industry-standard protocols for authentication and authorization, often used for integrating with third-party identity providers like Google or 
Facebook.

Custom authentication: 
	You can implement custom authentication schemes if your requirements are unique and not covered by the built-in methods.

Here's a basic example of setting up JWT authentication in ASP.NET Core Web API:

// In Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Add authentication services
    services.AddAuthentication(options =>
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    }).AddJwtBearer(options =>
    {
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidateLifetime = true,
            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
            ValidIssuer = "your_issuer",
            ValidAudience = "your_audience",
            IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("your_secret_key"))
        };
    });

    // Add authorization policy
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("RequireAdminRole", policy =>
            policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
    });

    // Other service configurations...
}

Authorization:
	determines what actions a user is allowed to perform once they are authenticated. ASP.NET Core provides a flexible authorization system that allows you to 
define policies based on roles, claims, or custom requirements.
To use authorization in your Web API, you can apply the [Authorize] attribute to controller actions or use policy-based authorization:

[Authorize]
public class SecureController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetSecureData()
    {
        // Only authenticated users can access this action
        // Add additional authorization logic as needed
    }
}

You can also use policy-based authorization:

[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdminRole")]
public class AdminController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetAdminData()
    {
        // Only users with the "Admin" role can access this action
    }
}

In this example, the RequireAdminRole policy ensures that only users with the "Admin" role can access the associated controller actions.

In summary, authentication verifies a user's identity, while authorization defines what actions they are allowed to perform. ASP.NET Core provides a robust framework 
for implementing these security features in your Web API, ensuring that your application remains secure and only accessible to authorized users.
