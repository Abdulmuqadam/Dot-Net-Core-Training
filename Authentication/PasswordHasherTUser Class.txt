PasswordHasher class:
The PasswordHasher<TUser> class is a commanly used component in many authnetication systems, particularly in the context of web applications. It's responsible for 
securely hashing and verifying user passwords.

Here's an explanation of this class
The PasswordHasher<TUser> class is a component used in user authentication systems to enhance the security of storing and verifying user passwords. It is a generic 
class, meaning it can work with different types of user objects (TUser), making it adaptable to various application scenarios.

Here's how it typically works:

1. Hashing Passwords: 
	When a user creates an account or updates their password, the PasswordHasher takes the plain-text password provided by the user and generates a secure 
cryptographic hash from it. This hash is a one-way transformation, meaning it cannot be reversed to obtain the original password. This ensures that even if the 
password hashes are somehow exposed, the actual passwords remain secret.

2. Verifying Passwords: 
	When a user attempts to log in, they provide their plain-text password. The PasswordHasher can then compare this plain-text password with the previously 
stored hashed password. If they match, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied. Importantly, during this verification process, the original plain-text password 
is not stored or transmitted in any way.

3. Salting: 
	Good password hashers also incorporate a "salt" into the password hashing process. A salt is a random value that is unique for each user. It ensures that even 
if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will look different due to the unique salt. This adds an extra layer of security against attacks like 
rainbow tables.

4. Work Factor:
	Password hashers often allow you to configure a "work factor" or "cost factor." This determines how computationally expensive it is to calculate the hash. A 
higher work factor makes it more difficult for attackers to perform a brute-force or dictionary attack against the hashed passwords.

By using the PasswordHasher<TUser> class, developers can implement secure password handling in their applications without having to delve into the low-level details 
of cryptographic hashing algorithms. It abstracts away the complexities, ensuring that user passwords are stored and verified securely.
