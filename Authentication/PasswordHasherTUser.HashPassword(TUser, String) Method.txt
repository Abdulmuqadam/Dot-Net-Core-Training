PasswordHasherTUser.HashPassword(TUser,String)Method:
	is a functionality provided by ASP.NET Core's Identity framework, which is used for securely hashing and storing user passwords.

Here's a breakdown of the method signature:

PasswordHasher<TUser>: 
	This is a generic class in ASP.NET Core Identity that handles password hashing for a specific user type (TUser is a generic type parameter representing the 
user type). It provides methods for hashing and verifying passwords.
HashPassword(TUser, String): 
	This is a method within the PasswordHasher<TUser> class. It is used to hash a user's password provided as a String and associate it with a specific user 
(TUser). 

The method takes two parameters:
TUser: 
	This parameter represents the user for whom you want to hash the password. It typically corresponds to a user object or entity in your application.
String: 
	This parameter represents the plain-text password that you want to hash.

The purpose of this method is to securely hash the plain-text password before storing it in a database or another storage medium. This is essential for protecting 
user passwords from unauthorized access in case of a security breach.
