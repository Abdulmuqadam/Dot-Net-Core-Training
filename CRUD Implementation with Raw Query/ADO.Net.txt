ADO.NET: 
	which stands for Active Data Objects for .NET, is a technology used in Microsoft's .NET framework for working with data from various sources such as databases, 
XML, and more. It provides a set of classes and libraries that allow developers to interact with data in a flexible and efficient manner.

ADO.NET consists of several key components:

Connection: 
	ADO.NET allows you to establish connections to data sources like databases. You can specify the type of database you want to connect to (e.g., SQL Server, 
Oracle, MySQL) and provide connection details.

Command: 
	You can create commands to execute SQL queries or stored procedures against the connected data source. ADO.NET supports various types of commands, including 
SqlCommand, OleDbCommand, and OracleCommand.

DataReader: 
	The DataReader allows you to efficiently read data from a data source one record at a time. It's a forward-only, read-only cursor that minimizes memory usage.

DataSet: 
	A DataSet is an in-memory representation of data retrieved from a data source. It can contain multiple DataTables, each of which represents a table of data. 
You can perform various operations on the data within a DataSet, such as filtering, sorting, and relating tables.

DataAdapter: 
	The DataAdapter acts as a bridge between a DataSet and a data source. It facilitates the transfer of data between the two, including retrieving data from the 
data source into a DataSet and updating changes made in the DataSet back to the data source.

Connection Pooling: 
	ADO.NET includes connection pooling, which helps manage and reuse database connections to improve performance and resource utilization.

ADO.NET is commonly used for developing database-driven applications in .NET, such as web applications, desktop applications, and services. It provides a flexible and 
efficient way to work with data, making it a fundamental part of data access in the .NET ecosystem. Developers can choose from different data providers (e.g., 
System.Data.SqlClient for SQL Server, System.Data.OracleClient for Oracle) based on the specific data source they are working with.
