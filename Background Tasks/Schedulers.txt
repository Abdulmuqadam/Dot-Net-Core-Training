Schedulers:
	In a C#.NET Core WebAPI application, you can use schedulers to manage and control the execution of background tasks or recurring jobs. There are various 
approaches and libraries you can use for scheduling tasks in a .NET Core WebAPI application. Here are a few options:

Hangfire:
	Hangfire is a popular library for scheduling background tasks in ASP.NET Core applications, including WebAPI. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for 
creating background jobs. To use Hangfire, you need to install the Hangfire NuGet package and configure it in your application. Here's a basic example:

// Install the Hangfire NuGet package
// Configure Hangfire in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...
    services.AddHangfire(config => config.UseSqlServerStorage("connectionString"));
    // ...
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    // ...
    app.UseHangfireDashboard();
    app.UseHangfireServer();
    // ...
}

// Create a background job
BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => SomeMethodToExecuteInBackground());

Quartz.NET:
	Quartz.NET is a powerful scheduling library that allows you to create complex scheduling scenarios. You can use Quartz.NET to schedule jobs in your WebAPI 
application. To get started, you need to install the Quartz NuGet package and configure it in your application. Here's a basic example:

// Install the Quartz NuGet package
// Configure Quartz in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...
    services.AddQuartz(q =>
    {
        q.UseMicrosoftDependencyInjectionJobFactory();

        q.AddJob<YourJobClass>(j => j.WithIdentity("your-job"));
        q.AddTrigger(t => t
            .ForJob("your-job")
            .WithIdentity("your-job-trigger")
            .WithCronSchedule("0/30 * * * * ?")); // Example: Run every 30 seconds
    });

    services.AddQuartzHostedService(options => options.WaitForJobsToComplete = true);
    // ...
}

// Create your job class
public class YourJobClass : IJob
{
    public Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
    {
        // Your job logic here
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

Timer-based approach:
	You can use the built-in .NET System.Threading.Timer class to schedule tasks in your WebAPI application. This approach is suitable for simple periodic tasks. 
Here's an example:

var timer = new Timer(DoWork, null, TimeSpan.Zero, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15)); // Execute DoWork every 15 minutes

private void DoWork(object state)
{
    // Your task logic here
}
