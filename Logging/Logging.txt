Logging:
	In C# .NET WebAPI, logging is a fundamental practice for recording important information, errors, and events that occur during the execution of your web API 
application. Logging helps developers and administrators monitor and troubleshoot issues in production or development environments. It is especially crucial in web 
API applications to track incoming requests, outgoing responses, and various activities within the application.

Here's how you can implement logging in a C# .NET WebAPI application:

Choose a Logging Framework: 
	.NET provides various logging frameworks, but the most commonly used one is Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, which is part of the .NET Core and .NET 5+ ecosystem.
You can also use third-party libraries like Serilog, NLog, or log4net if preferred.

Configure Logging: 
	You need to configure the logging framework of your choice in your WebAPI application. This usually involves specifying where log messages should be written 
(e.g., console, files, databases) and setting log levels (e.g., information, warning, error, debug).

Inject ILogger: 
	In your WebAPI controllers or services, you can inject an ILogger instance. This allows you to log information specific to the current component.

using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyController> _logger;

    public MyController(ILogger<MyController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Getting data from API.");
        // ... Your API logic here
        return Ok();
    }
}

Log Messages: 
	Use the ILogger instance to log messages, errors, or any relevant information at various points in your code. You can log messages with different log levels 
depending on their severity.

_logger.LogInformation("This is an informational message.");
_logger.LogWarning("This is a warning message.");
_logger.LogError("This is an error message.");

Log Exception Details: 
	When an exception occurs in your API, it's a good practice to log exception details to help diagnose issues

try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while processing the request.");
}

Review Logs: 
	Log messages can be written to various outputs, such as console, files, or databases. Ensure you have a strategy for collecting and reviewing logs, especially 
in a production environment.

Logging Levels: 
	Use appropriate log levels (e.g., LogInformation, LogWarning, LogError) to distinguish between different types of log messages. This allows you to filter and 
prioritize logs based on severity.

Logging in Middleware: 
	You can also log requests and responses at a global level using middleware, which can be useful for tracking incoming and outgoing traffic.

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    _logger.LogInformation($"Received request: {context.Request.Path}");
    await next();
    _logger.LogInformation($"Sent response: {context.Response.StatusCode}");
});
